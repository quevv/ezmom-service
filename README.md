**Controller** -> **Service** -> **Repository** -> **Model**

## Models
### Responsibility: 
Define the data structure and behavior.

* Data Representation: Models represent the data and the business logic associated with it. They define the schema for the database entities.
* Validation: Models can include validation logic to ensure data integrity.
* Business Logic: Encapsulate business rules and logic that pertain to the data.
* ORM Integration: In many cases, models are integrated with an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library like Sequelize or Mongoose to facilitate database interactions.

## Controllers
### Responsibility: 
Handle incoming HTTP requests and responses.

* Request Handling: Controllers receive HTTP requests, process them (including validating input), and send back the appropriate HTTP response.
* Interaction with Services: Controllers often delegate the actual processing of data to services. They act as an intermediary between the user interface (API endpoints) and the business logic.

## Services
### Responsibility: 
Contain the business logic and orchestrate complex operations.

* Business Logic: Services encapsulate the business logic of the application. They handle the main processing of data and operations that are not specific to any single model.
* Coordination: Services often coordinate operations involving multiple models or external APIs.
* Reusability: Services can be reused across different controllers, promoting code reuse and separation of concerns.

## Repositories
### Responsibility: 
Abstract the database access.

* Data Access: Repositories are responsible for all direct interactions with the database. They provide an abstraction layer over the database queries.
* CRUD Operations: They typically contain methods for Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) operations and any complex queries needed by the application.
* Separation of Concerns: By abstracting data access logic, repositories keep the database operations separate from the business logic.
